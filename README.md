## Description: <a name="description"></a>
Completed as an assignment for Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp, this project uses Javascript and Node to streamline the process of creating a clear and organized readme file in markdown.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
Because the project uses Inquirer, users should check that it is installed to ensure the project functions.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Once the project has been installed, the user simply opens the index.js file in the terminal  and enters `node index.js`. The generator will then prompt the user for information about the project.

## Contributing <a name="contributing"></a>
If you would like to contribute to the project, please contact me on GitHub. More work could be done to better organize and streamline the index.js file.

## Tests <a name="tests"></a>
The project began with simply testing if inquirer was installed and running, using a basic prompt. Next, an array of questions (the const `questions`) was created and used for the prompt. After it was confirmed that these questions worked without any issues, code to write a file based on the responses was created. Once this worked, a template was created for the markdown file as well as a function to  provide a license tag based on the selected license. The final product was tested to make sure that issues such as special characters, capitals, and blank strings would not cause issues.
